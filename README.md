Q.3: In this same GitHub repository, create a new branch ‘geometry-calculator’, we'll work on a simple Python program that calculates the area of a circle and the area of a rectangle. We'll use Git stash to switch between working on multiple features (calculating circle area and calculating rectangle area) without committing incomplete changes.

Performed below steps:
-Created new branch called 'geometry-calculator'.
-Implemented a new feature a simple Python program that calculates the area of a circle and the area of a rectangle.
-Created new branch called 'feature_circle_area'.
-Implemnted code to call function 'calculate_rectangle_area' by passing radius as parameter.
-Stash the changes.
-Created new branch called 'feature_rectangle_area'.
-Implemnted code to call function 'calculate_rectangle_area' by passing length and width as parameter.
-Stash the changes.
-Switch back to branch feature_circle_area.
-Pop stash changes.
-Code changes commit and push to branch feature_circle_area on repo.
-Switch back to branch feature_rectangle_area.
-Pop stash changes.
-Code changes commit and push to branch feature_rectangle_area on repo.
-Added Collabrator on repo for code review.
-Create pull request with collabrator as reviewer for branch feature_circle_area to merge code into geometry-calculator branch.
-Collabrator review changes and approve changes.
-After getting approval merge changes.
-Create pull request with collabrator as reviewer for branch feature_rectangle_area to merge code into geometry-calculator branch.
-Collabrator review changes and approve changes.
-After getting approval merge changes.
-Finally merge geometry-calculator branch changes into main branch.
