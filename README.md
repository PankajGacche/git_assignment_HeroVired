-Added one collabrator to my repository to review my code.

-Created new branch called 'feature_sqrt'.
-Added squr_root code to this branch.
-Switched back to the ‘dev’ branch.
-Made fixes for divide function in 'dev'.
-Make sure and keep same changes in 'feature_sqrt' branch.
-Create pull request from dev branch to main branch.
-While creating pull request added reviewer as addedd collabrator and send request for code approval.
